### Github

Github has more than 50 million users. Github represents more than 100 million repositories (As of August 2019). https://github.com/about

* + You can create private and public repositories for free.
* + They offers you a pack of services for free if you are a Student.
* + Github pages.
* + Security notifications.
* + Dependency analysis.
* + Commit graph and reporting tools
* + Issues
* + Track Comment Changes (View the full history of comment updates)
* + Initialize README on project creation
* - Only support Git.

### GitLab

In 2017, after a cyber attack, a database admin deleted the production database ! Six hours of issues and merge requests lost ! The recovery process was completely streamed on Youtube (A way to recover the costs of the recovery ? üòÇ)

* + A big advantage of Gitlab is that you can self host a Gitlab server. I already tested it once. Personally, I liked it.
* + Confidential issues. Gitlab allows you to create confidential issues that are visible only to the project member(s) with the Reporter role or above.
* + Gitlab is open source, so if something bothers you and you know Ruby, you can change it as long as you don't break it üòÇ.
* + Free CI/CD with shared or personal Runners
* + Commit graph and reporting tools
* + import from SVN to Git. import GitHub, Bitbucket, Google Code, FogBugz, Gitea and from any Git URL* + GitLab allows you to export your project to other systems.
* + Issues + Issue Weights + Confidential Issues + Related Issues + Move Issue to Another Project + Export Issues CSV file + Mark Issue as Duplicate
* + Create new branches from issues
* + Web IDE
* + Initialize README on project creation

### BitBucket

In August 2019, Bitbucket showed their plan to stop supporting Mercurial repositories in 1 June 2020. And Stop supporting Mercurial means deleting all traces of Mercurial in their API and deleting permanently all the Mercurial repositories (Public & Private).

* + One huge advantage of Bitbucket, is its integration with all the Atlassian services like JIRA, Confluence, Trello,

* - Very small community compared to Github.
* - Sometimes seems buggy or unresponding.
* - Not intuitive.
