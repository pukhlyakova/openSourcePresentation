## Gitlab VS Github VS BitBucket

### Github

Github has more than 40 million users, including 10 million who joined the platform in 2019. Github represents more than 44 million repositories created last year. And it's more than 20 million issues closed last year. Source - https://octoverse.github.com/.

* + You can create private and public repositories for free.
* + They offers you a pack of services for free if you are a Student.
* + Github pages.
* + Security notifications.
* + Dependency analysis.
* + Commit graph and reporting tools
* + Issues
* + Track Comment Changes (View the full history of comment updates)
* + Initialize README on project creation
* - Only support Git.

### GitLab

In 2017, after a cyber attack, a database admin deleted the production database ! Six hours of issues and merge requests lost ! The recovery process was completely streamed on Youtube (A way to recover the costs of the recovery ? üòÇ)

* + A big advantage of Gitlab is that you can self host a Gitlab server. I already tested it once. Personally, I liked it.
* + Confidential issues. Gitlab allows you to create confidential issues that are visible only to the project member(s) with the Reporter role or above.
* + Gitlab is open source, so if something bothers you and you know Ruby, you can change it as long as you don't break it üòÇ.
* + Free CI/CD with shared or personal Runners
* + Commit graph and reporting tools
* + import from SVN to Git. import GitHub, Bitbucket, Google Code, FogBugz, Gitea and from any Git URL* + GitLab allows you to export your project to other systems.
* + Issues + Issue Weights + Confidential Issues + Related Issues + Move Issue to Another Project + Export Issues CSV file + Mark Issue as Duplicate
* + Create new branches from issues
* + Web IDE
* + Initialize README on project creation

### BitBucket

In August 2019, Bitbucket showed their plan to stop supporting Mercurial repositories in 1 June 2020. And Stop supporting Mercurial means deleting all traces of Mercurial in their API and deleting permanently all the Mercurial repositories (Public & Private).

* + One huge advantage of Bitbucket, is its integration with all the Atlassian services like JIRA, Confluence, Trello,

* - Very small community compared to Github.
* - Sometimes seems buggy or unresponding.
* - Not intuitive.
